# unofficial fireduino board package
I couldn't download the arduino IDE from the official Fireduino page so i made this repo
To install paste
> https://github.com/okb64/fireduino-arduino-unofficial/releases/download/test/package_fireduino_index.json
into the Arduino IDE board mannager box

Still need to install the board drivers. I just know it has to (should) be a rockUSB driver
